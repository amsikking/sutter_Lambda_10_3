# sutter_Lambda_10_3
Python device adaptor: Sutter Lambda 10-3 optical filter changer and SmartShutterÂ® control system.
## Quick start:
- Plug the wheel into 'A' and use the 'RS232' port with an FTDI serial to USB cable (or equivalent) and power up the box.
- To use the RS232 port the display on the controller should be in mode 'S' (serial). If it is showing some other mode (like 'U') then use the front of the controller to set the default communication to 'S'. To do this press -> Local -> Mode -> 7 1 4 2 0 and then restart the controller. The display should now show 'S'.
